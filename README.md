# COIN-OR Linear Programming Interface (Clp.jl)

![](https://www.coin-or.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/COINOR.png)

`Clp.jl` is an interface to the **[COIN-OR Linear
Programming](https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp)** solver. It provides a complete
interface to the low-level C API, as well as an implementation of the
solver-independent `MathOptInterface` API.

*Note: This wrapper is maintained by the JuliaOpt community and is not a COIN-OR
project.*

## Installation

The package can be installed with `Pkg.add`.

```
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("Clp")
```

Clp.jl will use [BinaryProvider.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryProvider.jl) to automatically install the Clp binaries. This should work for both the official Julia binaries from `https://julialang.org/downloads/` and source-builds.

## Custom Installation

To install custom built Clp binaries set the environmental variable `JULIA_CLP_LIBRARY_PATH` and call `import Pkg; Pkg.build("Clp")`. For instance, if the libraries are installed in `/opt/lib`, then call
```julia
ENV["JULIA_CLP_LIBRARY_PATH"] = "/opt/lib"
import Pkg; Pkg.build("Clp")
```
If you do not want BinaryProvider to download the default binaries on install, set `JULIA_CLP_LIBRARY_PATH` before calling `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Clp")`.

To switch back to the default binaries clear `JULIA_CLP_LIBRARY_PATH` and call `import Pkg; Pkg.build("Clp")`.

### Using with **[JuMP]**
[JuMP]: https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl

Due to some restrictions in Clp's C api, the Clp's MathOptInterface wrapper does not support directly modifying a problem after it has been created, e.g., changing variable bounds or modifying constraints coefficients.

Therefore, we highly recommend that you use the `Clp.jl` package with higher-level package such as [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl).
This can be done with following syntax:
```julia
using JuMP, Clp

model = Model(Clp.Optimizer)
set_optimizer_attribute(model, "LogLevel", 1)
set_optimizer_attribute(model, "Algorithm", 4)
```

See the list of options below.

Furthermore, the following features are not supported:
* Querying the dual bound via `JuMP.objective_bound` (not in the C API)
* Setting a time limit (the C API behaves inconsistently, see [#65](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Clp.jl/issues/65))
* Setting the number of threads used (not in the C API)
* Quadratic objective (not supported yet)

### Solver options

Options are solver-dependent. The following options are the most useful (and well documented):

* ``PrimalTolerance`` - primal feasibility tolerance (default 1e-7)
* ``DualTolerance`` - dual feasibility tolerance (default 1e-7)
* ``DualObjectiveLimit`` - when using dual simplex (where the objective is monotonically changing), terminate when the objective exceeds this limit
* ``MaximumIterations`` - terminate after performing this number of simplex iterations
* ``MaximumSeconds`` - terminate after this many seconds have passed
* ``LogLevel`` - set to 1, 2, 3, or 4 for increasing output (default 0)
* ``PresolveType`` - set to 1 to disable presolve
* ``SolveType`` - choose the solution method:

    - 0 - dual simplex
	- 1 - primal simplex
	- 3 - barrier with crossover to optimal basis
	- 4 - barrier without crossover to optimal basis
	- 5 - automatic

* ``InfeasibleReturn`` - set to 1 to return as soon as the problem is found to be infeasible (by default, an infeasibility proof is computed as well)
